0,This NER work is just a small part of the work we are doing at the UN Emerging Technology Lab (ETL) to accelerate the UNs mission.,0
1,A one time offline processing creates a mapping from the sets of context independent signatures harvested from BERTs vocabulary to a single descriptor/label.,0
2,"BERTs cased vocabulary is a mixture of common nouns, proper nouns, subwords and symbols. The resulting set of 21,418 terms a mixture of common nouns and proper nouns serve as descriptors characterizing an entity type.",1
3,A tokenizer is responsible for preparing the text inputs as inputs to the transformer model,1
4,NERDA is open-sourced and available on the Python Package Index (PyPI). It can be installed with:,0
5,We will use the English CoNLL-2003 data set with NER annotations for training and validation of our model.,0
6,"Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are designed to work with sequential data. Sequential data(can be time-series) can be in form of text, audio, video etc.",1
7,RNN uses the previous information in the sequence to produce the current output. To understand this better Im taking an example sentence.,0
8,The workflow of GRU is same as RNN but the difference is in the operations inside the GRU unit. Lets see the architecture of it.,0
9,"In the LSTM layer, I used 5 neurons and it is the first layer (hidden layer) of the neural network, so the input_shape is the shape of the input which we will pass.",1
10,A Recurrent Neural Network is a network with a loop. It processes information sequentially and the output from every time step is fed back to the network which acts as a sort of memory.,1
11,the concatenated vector is passed through a fully connected layer to get a new vector. This vector is passed through the softmax activation.,0
